<div class=ls>Some joysticks supports more than 4 buttons (by using pins and input meant for the second joystick, using normally unused pins, or changing the joystick's circuits to read a 4-bit state code) but typically require a special device driver for the additional buttons to work.
<br>Some high-end joysticks rely on multiplexing data through the 4 standard button inputs and/or the unused pins, achieving support for a rather high number of buttons and special features such as daisy-chaining, force feedback or joystick programming.
<br><br><br><b>MIDI connectors</b><br>Since the game port moved to sound cards, these connectors usually double as connectors for MIDI instruments; two of the redundant +5V and GND pins of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output.
